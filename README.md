PHP mysql website

Website link http://infogen.unaux.com/

This is a demo project. Designed with MaterializeCSS framework and Vanilla PHP is used for backend functionalities.

To create a simple card by pressing CREATE YOU CARD and filling up the form on that page. Then it will be displayed in the home page. As of now, I haven't added any funtionality for uploading picture so it will be replaced with a dummy picture.
To delete the card press the "More info" below that card it will redirect you to another page where you can see a few more details about the card and also the delete button is there which will delete it completely from the database.

Also the contact form works! PHPMailer is used to make the contact form work.
